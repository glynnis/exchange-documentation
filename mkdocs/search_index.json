The Abstract section is the description that will display in Exchange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \n button, and select the edit button under Metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nEdit Metadata\n page will display.\n\n\n\n\nEdit the information fields to include anything pertinent to the layer.\n\n\nClick the \n button at either the top or bottom of the page to save your changes.\n\n\n\n\nEdit Permissions\n\n\nLayer permissions are established when the layer is first imported, but the administrator/owner of the layer can adjust those permissions as needed. Permissions allow you to manage who can view/download the data, who can make edits, and who can manage the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet permissions for the resource to give the required access to the layer. Permissions can be granted to Anyone for viewing and downloading, if the checkbox is selected.

The first-order CSW endpoint provides collection level filtering of all metadata records. The all metadata CSW endpoint provides all levels of metadata at varying levels of granularity.\n\n\nAny client supporting CSW (desktop, GIS, web application, client library, etc.) can integrate the Data.gov CSW endpoints.\n\n\nInteracting with the Data.gov CSW\n\n\nThe Data.gov CSW endpoints are implemented using pycsw. pycsw is an OGC CSW server implementation written in Python, enabling the publishing and discovery of data and services, providing a standards-based metadata and catalogue component of spatial data infrastructures. pycsw is Certified OGC Compliant and is an OGC Reference Implementation.\n\n\nData.gov CSW endpoints\n\n\nThe Data.gov CSW endpoints support the OGC CSW 2.0.2 standard as well as the ISO Metadata Application 1.0.0 Profile. The CSW endpoints operate over HTTP GET, POST (XML) and SOAP.\n\n\nMaking HTTP POST (XML) requests\n\n\nWhile making HTTP GET requests is relatively straightforward, HTTP POST (XML) requests require the client to open the connection and send the request XML as the payload. Below are a few examples on how to run HTTP POST (XML) requests on the command line:\n\n\n\n\nService Endpoints\n\n\nFirst-order metadata: http://catalog.data.gov/csw\n\n\nAll metadata: http://catalog.data.gov/csw-all\n\n\nWe will use the first-order CSW endpoint for the examples below.\n\n\nGetCapabilities\n\n\nThe \nGetCapabilities\n operation provides CSW clients with service metadata about the CSW service as an XML document.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nHTTP GET:\n http://catalog.data.gov/csw?service=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetCapabilities\n\n\nHTTP POST (XML):\n\n\n\n\nDescribeRecord\n\n\nThe DescribeRecord operation provides CSW clients with elements of supported information models of the CSW service.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nHTTP GET:\n http://catalog.data.gov/csw?service=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=DescribeRecord\n\n\nHTTP POST (XML):\n\n\n\n\nGetDomain\n\n\nThe GetDomain operation provides an interface to return all possible values for a given metadata property/queryable or parameter.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nHTTP GET:\n http://catalog.data.gov/csw?service=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetDomain\npropertyname=dc:type\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?service=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetDomain\nparametername=GetRecords.outputSchema\n\n\nHTTP POST (XML):\n\n\n\n\nGetRecords\n\n\nThe GetRecords operation provides a query interface to search for data both using spatial predicates as well as attribute / temporal queries, or both. GetRecords queries are best invoked as HTTP POST (XML). Examples:\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust the startPosition and maxRecords parameters to customize / page responses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust the optional outputSchema parameter to customize output format (default is Dublin Core [http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/2.0.2], use http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd for ISO)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBounding box queries and responses always use axis order latitude longitude\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust the optional csw:ElementSetName parameter (brief, summary [default], full) to adjust verbosity of metadata record responses. The following table provides an overview of the elements returned:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturnable elements\n\n\n\n\nQuery all records, return records 1 - 15:\n\n\n\n\nQuery records with a bounding box:\n\n\n\n\nQuery records by attribute:\n\n\n\n\nQuery records by full text search:\n\n\n\n\nand part of the response:\n\n\n\n\nQuery records by combined bounding box and full text search:\n\n\n\n\nQuery the total number of records in the catalogue (HTTP GET):\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?service=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecords\ntypenames=csw:Record\nelementsetname=brief\n\n\nGetRecordById\n\n\nThe GetRecordById operation returns defailed information for specific metadata records.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nHTTP GET:\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?service=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecordById\nid=16bbf4f8-8e88-45c6-a76b-6af51b2b3555\nelementsetname=full\n\n\nHTTP GET (ISO 19139):\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?service=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecordById\nid=16bbf4f8-8e88-45c6-a76b-6af51b2b3555\nelementsetname=full\noutputSchema=http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd\n\n\nHTTP GET (ISO 19139 brief):\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?service=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecordById\nid=16bbf4f8-8e88-45c6-a76b-6af51b2b3555\nelementsetname=brief\noutputSchema=http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd\n\n\nHTTP POST (XML):\n\n\n\n\nSearching Collections\n\n\nThe Data.gov CSW supports searches within for collections. The following query searches for all records that are part of a collection via the \napiso:ParentIdentifier\n core queryable:\n\n\n\n\nOpenSearch Geo and Time Extensions\n\n\nThe Data.gov CSW endpoints support the OGC OpenSearch Geo and Time Extensions 1.0 standard. This provides a lightweight mechanism to query the catalogue via HTTP GET for simple spatial and temporal searches.\n\n\nTo query the Data.gov via OpenSearch, requests must be specificed with mode=opensearch. The following parameters are supported:\n\n\n\n\n{searchTerms}\n (keywords)\n\n\n{geo:box}\n (bounding box of minx,miny,maxx,maxy)\n\n\n{time:start}\n and \n{time:end}\n (temporal)\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying combinations of these parameters constitutes an exclusive search.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nAutodiscovery:\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?mode=opensearch\nservice=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetCapabilities\n\n\nKeywords:\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?mode=opensearch\nservice=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecords\nelementsetname=full\nresulttype=results\ntypenames=csw:Record\nq=idaho\n\n\nBounding Box:\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?mode=opensearch\nservice=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecords\nelementsetname=full\nresulttype=results\ntypenames=csw:Record\nbbox=-140,20,-40,40\n\n\nTemporal Extent (range):\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?mode=opensearch\nservice=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecords\nelementsetname=full\nresulttype=results\ntypenames=csw:Record\ntime=2001/2004\n\n\nTemporal Extent (since 2004):\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?mode=opensearch\nservice=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecords\nelementsetname=full\nresulttype=results\ntypenames=csw:Record\ntime=2004/\n\n\nTemporal Extent (before 2004):\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?mode=opensearch\nservice=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecords\nelementsetname=full\nresulttype=results\ntypenames=csw:Record\ntime=/2004\n\n\nTemporal Extent (2001/2007) and Keywords:\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?mode=opensearch\nservice=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecords\nelementsetname=full\nresulttype=results\ntypenames=csw:Record\ntime=2001/2007\nq=fauna\n\n\nTemporal Extent (2001/2007) and Bounding Box:\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?mode=opensearch\nservice=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecords\nelementsetname=full\nresulttype=results\ntypenames=csw:Record\ntime=2001/2007\nbbox=-140,20,-40,40\n\n\nKeywords and Bounding Box:\n\n\nhttp://catalog.data.gov/csw?mode=opensearch\nservice=CSW\nversion=2.0.2\nrequest=GetRecords\nelementsetname=full\nresulttype=results\ntypenames=csw:Record\nq=vegetation\nbbox=-140,20,-40,40",
